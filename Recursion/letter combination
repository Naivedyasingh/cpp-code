Explaination-------------
Step 1: Setup
digits = "23"
We initialize the mapping array as follows:
cpp
Copy code
string mapping[10] = {"", "", "abc", "def", "ghi", "jkl", "mno", "pqrs", "tuv", "wxyz"};
The main letterCombinations function initializes ans as an empty vector and calls the recursive solve function with parameters:
cpp
Copy code
solve(digits, output, index = 0, ans, mapping);
Step 2: Recursive Process Using solve
Let's trace the recursive calls made by solve step-by-step:

First Call to solve:

digits = "23", output = "", index = 0.
The first digit is 2, which maps to "abc" in mapping.
We start a loop over each character in "abc" and recursively call solve for each.
Second Call to solve (when we choose 'a' from "abc"):

output = "a", index = 1.
Now, we move to the next digit, which is 3 (mapping to "def").
We loop over each character in "def" and recursively call solve.
Third Call to solve (when we choose 'd' from "def" with output = "a"):

output = "ad", index = 2.
Here, index == digits.size(), so we have a complete combination.
We add "ad" to ans and backtrack by removing 'd' from output to explore other options.
Backtracking and Exploring Other Combinations:

After adding "ad" to ans, we go back to the third call with output = "a", index = 1.
Next, we choose 'e' from "def" and recursively call solve with output = "ae".
This leads to a complete combination "ae", which is added to ans.
We backtrack and continue with the next character, 'f', eventually adding "af" to ans.
Returning to Explore More Options in "abc":

Once all combinations starting with "a" ("ad", "ae", "af") are added to ans, we backtrack to the first call (index = 0) to explore the next characters in "abc": 'b' and 'c'.
Repeating the Process for 'b' and 'c':

With output = "b" and output = "c", we go through the same recursive exploration with "def", generating combinations "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", and "cf".
Final Output
After all recursive calls are complete, ans contains:

cpp
Copy code
["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"]
Visualization of the Recursive Tree
The recursive calls for digits = "23" can be visualized as a tree:

arduino
Copy code
         ""
       / | \
     "a" "b" "c"
    / | \ / | \ / | \
 "ad" "ae" "af" "bd" "be" "bf" "cd" "ce" "cf"
Each path from the root to a leaf node represents a complete combination, which we store in ans. This is an example of backtracking where we build output character-by-character, explore all options, and backtrack after each full combination is recorded.

2-'0' value of it

In C++, when you see an expression like 2 - '0', it converts a character representing a digit into its integer value.

Here's how it works:

The character '0' has an ASCII value of 48.
The character '2' has an ASCII value of 50.
When you subtract '0' from '2':

cpp
Copy code
'2' - '0' = 50 - 48 = 2
This effectively converts the character '2' to the integer 2.

So, 2 - '0' (or more generally digit - '0') is a common way to convert a character digit (like '0' to '9') to its corresponding integer value (0 to 9).
